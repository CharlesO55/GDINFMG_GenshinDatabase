1,Albedo,Amber,"Albedo spends most of his time in his workshop, tinkering away with all of his awesome stuff. But, when you see him in person, you never can quite tell what he's thinking... Who knows what goes on in that mind of his...",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
2,Albedo,Diona,Alchemy genius? Hmm... I wonder if he knows of a way to finally help me make a drink that people don't like?,https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
3,Albedo,Jean,"Sometimes I feel that terms like ""genius"" were originally created for Albedo.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
4,Albedo,Kaeya,"Albedo, eh? Calm, collected, and incredibly talented. He's the type everybody likes, some even more so than others. What, you into him as well?",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
5,Albedo,Klee,"Me and Albedo have a secret code! Whenever he puts a sign on his workshop door saying ""Experiment in Progress,"" that's code for ""Come back later, Klee."" Albedo's really nice and he's so patient with me, so I don't mind waiting until he's finished with his work.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
6,Albedo,Lisa,"Albedo is quite the alchemist. Just say the word and he'll come up with a good solution. He's easy on the eyes too, just like you.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
7,Albedo,Mona,"Albedo? Ah... I envy his ability to solely focus on his research without getting bogged down in mundane worldly affairs. What a wonderful life! If that batty old lady hadn't had one too many screws loose, perhaps that's the life I'd be living by now myself...",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
8,Albedo,Rosaria,"He's like an oil painting you find hanging on the wall in some ancient hall, profound and mysterious... hard to see through. But what can I say, I find people with stories... interesting.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
9,Albedo,Sucrose,"Artistry: As his Assistant I learn so much each and every day. What's key is not his existing knowledge, but his talented way of thinking. No matter how complex the task at hand, his way of thinking ensures he gets to the bottom of it, and is able to explain it thoroughly. His methodologies are amazing... to me, it's where alchemy meets art. Talent: Talent? Let's hypothesize that he and I were to perform the same research — I'd spend my whole life playing catch up. But, my studying of bio-alchemy has nothing to do with evading his line of research, we just happen to have different interests and dreams — nothing more.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
10,Albedo,Venti,"How do you explain white chalk in black soil, or the earth's dense crust amidst the emptiness of space? Same reason the purest soil gave birth to human life... It's an ancient power with unmistakable properties. Trying to harness it is dangerous indeed, I can't imagine what would happen if someone lost control of it in the city... Ah, never mind! What goes on within Mondstadt's walls is up to Mondstadt's people to deal with!",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
11,Albedo,Xingqiu,"I've thought of all the illustrations I want for each of the major event in the next three volumes! I should write my thoughts down before I forget them, and send them to Mr. Kreideprinz...",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/312182
12,Alhaitham,Candace,"A truly unusual scholar, unlike any other I've ever met. He sees and thinks about things in his own unique way... I only hope he never wields his sharp mind against the peace of Aaru Village.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/383712
13,Alhaitham,Cyno,"I don't really like people who are too smart. They think they can control everything, and constantly venture to the fringes of danger. But Alhaitham is one of the more reliable ones. In most cases, he is actually in control of things and has the ability to avert potential disaster.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/383712
14,Alhaitham,Dehya,"He offered me a position in the Akademiya once. I declined — working in a place like that would bore me to death. He, on the other hand, is exactly the kind of person I can imagine working there... always talking in long, convoluted sentences, and in that snooty tone... Tsk.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/383712
15,Alhaitham,Dori,"He once came nosing around, asking my minions some questions to see what he could find out. Like I said, those Akademiya people are just pig-headed and dishonest. Why should I take the risk of others prying into my business? Right, my young apprentice?",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/383712
16,Alhaitham,Kaveh,"Temperament: I guarantee you'll never meet anyone else who's as infuriating as him! And for the record, yes, I would say that to his face. Sure, he's smart, and sure, geniuses often come with a bad temper, but that's only half the story with him... He knows perfectly well how to appear friendly and likable to others, he just doesn't want to. If he ever gives you the impression that he doens't really have a temper, or that he's rigidly logical like a machine, then you just don't know him well enough yet. He definitely has a personality, it's just... too big a personality. Most people wouldn't get it. It's Complicated: Alhaitham helped me out a fair amount recently. If we were still as close as we were during our student days, then I'd be thanking him every chance I got. Now, though... I can't seem get a word of appreciation out of my mouth. Even if I could, I wouldn't want to give him the satisfaction. I guess you could say our relationship is something of a mixed bag these days? Honestly, with everything that's happened, it almost feels like the universe has been playing pranks on us... It's hard to make sense of it all... too much to process for one lifetime. I will say that it's not every day that you get to know someone like him — I just wish he could rein in some of the worst excesses of his personality. Okay, yeah, that's never gonna happen.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/383712
17,Alhaitham,Layla,"I bet someone who's good enough to get a job like Scribe never has to worry about whether their projects will get approved or be successful. Wait... Oh shoot, if he's a Scribe, he probably doesn't have to do any projects in the first place. So lucky...",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/383712
18,Alhaitham,Nahida,"He holds a body of knowledge more advanced than most could imagine, and his mind is constantly thinking, so maybe nothing in this world could ever fool him. But is the wise man truly wise to view the mediocre majority as defective? Because without them, there is no us.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/383712
19,Alhaitham,Tighnari,"Be careful of Alhaitham. I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but he purely operates by rationality, so people often find his actions unacceptable. If you don't believe me, just ask his housemate - thanks to Alhaitham, he has more pent-up frustration than an angry Anemo Slime.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/383712

21,Amber,Barbara,I've seen Amber rushing out of Mondstadt on a mission countless times. Being an Outrider doesn't look easy.,https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297535
22,Amber,Bennett,"Oh, I know who you mean. The girl who's always charging around all over the place. She's always off adventuring in the wild, just like me... But if you ever see her near a cooking pot, you'll soon find a cloud of thick black smoke blowing in your direction, followed by the smell of burnt steak... Huh, maybe she was born unlucky too?",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297535
23,Amber,Collei,"Amber is amazing. She's friendly and has tons of enthusiasm, plus she's really brave and always does the right thing... She's the person I admire most of all! She's like a cozy fire that makes everyone around her feel warm. There's no way I'd be where I am today without her... So much time has gone by — I bet she's even more cool and confident than ever these days! Who knows if I'll ever be able to match her.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297535
24,Amber,Eula,"Amber's someone who thinks for herself. On the day I first joined the Knights, she cleaned my dormitory and gave me a tour of the headquarters, and she's helped me with a myriad of other things in the time since. Now, everyone looks at me like the older sibling who needs the younger sibling to do everything for them! Hmph. For this, she must pay!",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297535
25,Amber,Jean,"I must say that Amber's development has impressed me recently. I hope that one day, her deeds will become the words of a bard's tale.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297535
26,Amber,Kaeya,That Outrider is a clever and righteous knight. Be careful not to step out of line in front of her.,https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297535
27,Amber,Klee,Amber is the best! Baron Bunny is so fluffy and he even explodes! So. Cool.,https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297535
28,Amber,Lisa,"Amber was just a young girl when she joined the knights, an in the blink of an eye, she's turned into such a strong young lady. I'm curious to see what she'll be like a few years from now.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297535
29,Amber,Noelle,"I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it in my Person for luck, and it look quite alright, don't you think?",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297535
30,Amber,Sucrose,"I'm curious to why her doll is called ""Baron Bunny,"" it clearly has nothing to do with a rabbit at all. Oh, the headband makes it look like it has rabbit ears you say? Hmm... that's heavily reliant on the rabbit stereotype, is it not? Many rabbits' ears are floppy.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297535
31,Ayaka,Ayato,"I am confident in Ayaka's abilities. But I want her to be able to hold on to her innocence. She shouldn't have to get personally involved in power struggles, or confront the darker side of life head-on. As her older brother, it's my job to shield her from all of that... Heh, just... between the two of us, of course. Sorry, that got a little more private a little ore quickly than I'd intended.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/315215
32,Ayaka,Gorou,"The Yashiro Commission operates as part of the Shogunate, but on many issues they tend to side with the people of Inazuma. In fact, the Shirasagi Himegimi has managed to establish an excellent reputation for herself, despite facing pressure from both sides. I suppose she must know how to keep her composure at all times and navigate sensitive situations tactfully... There's much I could learn from her.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/315215
33,Ayaka,Heizou,I'm barely acquainted with the daughter of the Kamisato Clan. I'm glad that I'm not from some sort of prestigious family like that... it's definitely not the kind of life for me.,https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/315215
34,Ayaka,Kazuha,"I'm sure everyone living in Inazuma has heard of the ''Shirasagi Himegimi."" The lady of the Kamisato Clan is as perfect as a person can be, though our paths have seldom crossed. I wonder what she thinks of the state of Inazuma today?",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/315215
35,Ayaka,Raiden,"Kamisato... One of the most distinguished clans in all of Inazuma. Eh? That's exactly what the Shogun said? Well, A—Ayaka's also well-versed in the art of the sword.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/315215
36,Ayaka,Sara,"In the Kujou household, normally the only sound to be heard is that of soldiers training in the dojo. But in the Kamisato household, there is the sound of music, dance, bickering, and laughter... I have heard that Miss Kamisato is skilled in the game of Go, and have always hoped for an occasion to pay her a visit, but... I also worry that someone of a serious demeanor like myself may not quite fit in there.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/315215
37,Ayaka,Sayu,"As the eldest daughter of the Kamisato Clan, she always looks very graceful and elegant. But she got one of the shrine maidens to keep tabs on me and make sure I don't slack off... Why would she do that?",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/315215
38,Ayaka,Thoma,"Milady is in all respects a well-rounded person: erudite, compassionate, well-mannered, and elegant... The one thing she could do better is to speak her mind more. In fact, watch out for this the next time you're talking to her — sometimes, she looks like she's about to say something, but then she holds back. If that happens, keep asking her opinion, see if you can encourage her to open up a little.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/315215
39,Ayaka,Yae Miko,"I'm very fond indeed of the Yashiro Commission girl. She adroitly handles every matter that comes before her. Unfortunately, it's often thankless work. Pity. Were she not a member of the Kamisato Clan, I would have long since snatched her up for the Yae Publishing House.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/315215
40,Ayaka,Yoimiya,"Seriousness: We cooperate a lot due to work. Unlike people in the other two Commissions, she always lets me finish speaking and answers me seriously without showing any impatience. I'd say that the word ''ladylike'' was practically made just for her. Baths: We once discussed matters concerning the summer festival deep into the night. We were both really tired, and I invited her to go take a bath. But when she heard that it involved many people bathing in the same pool, she went red in an instant! That was when I first learned that noble ladies can't use public baths.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/315215
41,Ayato,None,None,https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/345514
42,Baizhu,Gaming,"Working as a guard and doing Wushou Dancing means I have a pretty injury-prone lifestyle. Good thing is, Dr. Baizhu's medicine is always there to save the day. Seriously, it's like the one thing people should pack before going on a long journey or family vacation. My workmates at the Secure Transport Agency always get me to bring some back for them when I come to Liyue Harbor.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/314348
43,Baizhu,Hu Tao,"Baizhu? Ugh, that guy...",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/314348
44,Baizhu,Keqing,"Everyone has faith in Dr. Baizhu's medical skills. He's the right guy to go to when you can't figure out what's wrong with you. Oh... the rumors, you say? The only one that I know for a fact is true is how disgusting his medicine tastes. It's not just the kids who find it bitter, it's left me with some horrible memories, too!",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/314348
45,Baizhu,Qiqi,I can never remember Dr. Baizhu's face. But I don't mind.,https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/314348
46,Baizhu,Shenhe,"The quality of his medicinal herbs is as good as it gets, he is also easy-going and considerate of others. By comparison, the little snake on his neck has no filter at all... Haha, don't worry, I didn't lift a finger against it, I won't go as far as getting into a quarrel with a snake.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/314348
47,Baizhu,Xiangling,"I can smell Mist Flowers! It must be Dr. Baizhu! What is he doing here? Uh— Are you okay? Do you feel faint? Is your stomach sore? Or is it a sore throat? I've got it, you're fatigued from all that adventurin! No?... You're fine? Phew! Otherwise, he would have made you drink some traditional herbal medicine — it's so bitter!",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/314348
48,Baizhu,Xiao,"You want... Baizhu to make a medicine to take away my pain? I understand your intentions, but mortal medicine has no effect on adepti.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/314348
49,Baizhu,Xinyan,"Dr. Baizhu's prescriptions are the tops at preserving my voice. I did an impromptu performance for him as thanks, but... the snake he keeps around his neck fainted away. Haha, now it ducks up Dr. Baizhu's sleeve every time I'm around. I only discovered afterwards that snakes are very sensitive to vibrations.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/314348
50,Baizhu,Yaoyao,"Dr. Baizhu's prescriptions are pretty effective. They're bitter, that's for sure, but they always say that about medicine: ""the bitter the better""! So I get it. Huh? Too bitter for you? Don't worry, I've got some Candied Dates here. One of these after you finish your medicine will take the taste away.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/314348
51,Barbara,Albedo,"Barbara? She's a very earnest Deaconess. I once had the opportunity to sketch her a simple portrait... What happened to the sketch? Ah yes... Albert offered to purchase it, but I rejected his bid and gave it to the Acting Grand Master. Social relations... really require a lot of effort.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297517
52,Barbara,Bennett,"She's the best singer and dancer out there! I always go to watch her in concert after and adventure goes south - it really lifts my mood, chanting along with all the other fans, cheering her on. It's really kinda magical! It's no wonder she's so popular... Boy, if I had even half her popularity as leader of my adventure team...",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297517
53,Barbara,Diona,"How come all my fans are drunk middle-aged men, while Barbara's are all young people...? Hmph! So stupid. Forget it!",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297517
54,Barbara,Eula,"Everyone loves her. What's her secret? Maybe I could learn a thing or two from her... Hmm, or maybe not. I can't imagine a ""Shining Idol"" would want anything to do with a descendant of a depraved dynasty.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297517
55,Barbara,Jean,"Barbara is a hard worker, but I feel she's too hard on herself sometimes... What? You ask me how I know all of this? It's because the order also manages the Church.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297517
56,Barbara,Lisa,"Have you heard Barbara sing before? Her angelic voice contains a magical healing energy. A different kind of magical energy from the one in my potions, of course. I wonder which on you prefer?",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297517
57,Barbara,Noelle,"We take tea breaks together sometimes. Often she'll start humming a tune, saying inspiration has come to her. I'm not the right person to give useful feedback on anything musical... But I still love spending time with Barbara.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297517

61,Beidou,Ganyu,"Recently, everyone in Yujing Terrace has been saying nasty things about The Crux Fleet. But in my personal opinion, Beidou's contribution to Liyue Harbor goes far beyond what those miserable rumor-loving heathens could even contemplate! ...Oops! I'm sorry, I... I'm not quite sure how that one slipped out...",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297528
62,Beidou,Gorou,"Captain Beidou values camaraderie, and her exceptional abilities command respect. She once said that she prefers to avoid involving her companions in disputes that don't concern them, which I can completely understand. That's why I only request her help when we have no one else to turn to.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297528
63,Beidou,Hu Tao,"Bedou is well-known in Liyue. She doesn't know me, but that's cool, me just knowing about her is enough. Aw man... I really do wanna make friends with her.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297528
64,Beidou,Kazuha,I owe Beidou my life. She took me in when I fled from Inazuma and gave me the courage to return there at the most difficult time of my life. She is a comrade in whom I and all the other sailors can place our trust.,https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297528
65,Beidou,Keqing,"That captain is always flouting the rules, and her personality really rubs people the wrong way. That said, The Crux Fleet is indispensable to Liyue Harbor. It's bit of an art, knowing when to enforce the rules and it's in everyone's interests to be more lenient. Thing is, the Tianquan is supposed to be the one enforcing the rules, but she always seems to be too busy...",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297528
66,Beidou,Kokomi,"Ah... back when Beidou and I were carrying out ambushes against the Shogun's Army together, I raised my concerns that the enemy might detect our approach. But Beidou assured me of her fleet's unwavering discipline, and that raids could be carried out without detection. In the end, she was right, and that's exactly what happened. Now, every time the Watatsumi fleet encounters some sort of bottleneck, I consider inviting her to come and give them her instruction. There's no doubt, she runs a tight ship...",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297528
67,Beidou,Ningguang,"Fines: That... captain. She clearly receives the adoration of many, but will always be the first to disregard the rules. The fines she has paid would be enough to buy her a whole new ship... Attitude: Perhaps you've never heard me speak like this. All that can be said has been said — both the good and the bad — but she still does as she pleases. Forget it. Keep Beidou out of my sight.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297528
68,Beidou,Shenhe,"I find I don't need to worry about etiquette with her, and unlike with some people, I don't need to rely on non-verbal cues to discern the true meaning of what she's saying. That makes me a lot more comfortable. The only problem is... Well, there are too many people around her all the time, and I heard there's also many crew members on her ship...

73,Beidou,Xinyan,"Her? She speaks her mind and has a big heart, and we get on great. The Crux's adventures are real epic. They've given me tons of inspiration in the past! I even wrote them a song. Nowadays, I just need to sing the first line, and most all sailors will join in. It's fast becoming a new sea shanty, it is.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297528

75,Beidou,Yoimiya,"Beidou's been helping me ship my fireworks out ever since Inazuma was locked down. I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her — and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright — they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise.",https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact/archives/297528

I keep telling her she oughtta cut herself some slack, take some time off, maybe go take a walk around Sumeru City, buy herself some nice new clothes or jewelry... but she always says the same old thing: She can't bear to leave the village unprotected.

86,Charlotte,Furina,"I've often seen Charlotte busily running back and forth lately. She still seems to be hoping to arrange an exclusive interview with me. No matter how many times I refuse, she still hasn't given up. To be honest, her persistence made me angry at first... but then she told me with a resolute look in her eyes that she wanted to let people understand the real Furina, and that she believed people would understand my troubles.

89,Charlotte,Lyney,"Charlotte has been trying to get me to agree to an interview ever since we met... Ugh, it feels like she's already asked twenty times now.

90,Charlotte,Navia,"Charlotte's known for her fast-and-furious reporting, but it's her photography skills that really impress me.

I honestly never expected to meet a matra who's so comfortable hanging out with scholars. Gotta say though, I can't stand his sense of humor. It really makes my skin crawl.

I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying.

The Abyss Order had packed it up like regular cargo and wanted it shipped from Dornman Port to Liyue Harbor. She was acting as a consultant for the merchant vessel, where she discovered something in the cargo - and then began to investigate, putting herself in grave danger. Had we arrived just a few minutes later, it's likely she wouldn't have been so fortunate. Assessment: We've kept in touch ever since. I like how smart she is. She knows the rules, but she also knows how to be flexible and act according to the situation. A few of the Knights would do well to take a leaf out of her book...
